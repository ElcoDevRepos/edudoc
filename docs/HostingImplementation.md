### 4. Integration Testing _(Not Started)_
- [ ] Path-based routing verification
- [ ] iframe integration verification
- [ ] Background jobs verification
- [ ] End-to-end testing

## Completed Steps
- Created database deployment workflow in GitHub Actions
- Created and reviewed safer database publish profile
- Decided on East US region for resources
- Decided on minimal initial resource sizing for test environment
- **Completed database deployment pipeline for test environment**
- **Successfully deployed database using GitHub Actions**
- **Configured Azure SQL resources and GitHub environment secrets**

## Next Actions
1. **Set up Application Gateway and Domain Configuration** _(Current Focus)_
   - Create Application Gateway
   - Configure custom domain
   - Set up path-based routing
   - Configure SSL certificate
2. **Update Frontend Configurations**
   - Configure base paths for both frontends
   - Update API endpoints
   - Test routing
3. **Test V5 backend deployment workflow**
   - Trigger manual deployment
   - Verify API functionality
4. **Complete V5 frontend deployment workflow**
   - Angular build and deployment steps
   - Environment-specific configuration
5. **Test end-to-end V5 application**
   - Backend API + Frontend integration
   - CORS configuration verification
6. **Add WebJobs back to legacy backend**
7. **Set up staging environment**

## Notes and Decisions
- Using GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Starting with test environment setup
- Database deployment as first component
- East US region for all resources
- Starting with minimal performance tier for test environment
- Browser-based access needed for internal employees
- Using Azure CLI for resource creation
- **Background jobs will run as Azure WebJobs within the backend App Service**
- **Legacy app architecture: 2 separate App Services (backend + frontend)**
- **Backend App Service will host both .NET API and WebJobs**
- **Single domain (hpc-edudoc-test.net) with path-based routing**
- **Application Gateway for routing management**
- **Version-specific base paths (/v4, /v5)**
