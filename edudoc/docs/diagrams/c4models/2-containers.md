The Architecture of the core headstart framework is comprised of:

1. Front End
1. Api
1. Service Layer
1. Model
1. Database

There are also many NPM and Nuget packages that interact with the core framework to complete its functionality. These packages are abstracted logical chunks of the code that are updated independantly and shared with all Edudoc platforms.
